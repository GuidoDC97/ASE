# Computer Systems Architecture
Repository for Computer Systems Architecture project.

AY 2019/2020

Group project consisting in accomplishing different exercises about **VHDL** components. It starts from building basic components such as mux and shift registers to complex systems in both microprogrammed and cabled logic.

Most of the components were also implementd on **FPGA** boards such as **Digilent Basys** and **Digilent Nexys 2**.

**Xilinx ISE Desgin suite** was used as IDE for programming both components and FPGA boards.

Detailed description of assigned exercises can be found **[here](/Tracce%20per%20esercizi%20finali.pdf)**. 

## Documentation & Code

Complete documentation in LaTex about developed components can be found **[here](/Elaborato_Finale_ASE.pdf)**.

All components code is organized in directories with names that starts with "**Esercizio***".
